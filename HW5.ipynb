The outcome of the test tells us about the population, not just the sample we observed.\n",

    "Fisher's Tea Experiment: STA130 Students Hypothesis Test\n",
    "Problem Introduction\n",
    "In this experiment, we're exploring whether STA130 students can reliably distinguish between tea and milk being poured first, similar to the famous tea experiment conducted by Ronald Fisher. In the original experiment, Fisher sought to determine if Dr. Muriel Bristol could reliably tell whether tea or milk was poured first. Dr. Bristol correctly identified all 8 cups in the experiment, leading Fisher to test if this outcome could occur by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our version, we have 80 STA130 students, 49 of whom correctly identified the order in which tea or milk was poured. We aim to analyze whether this result is significantly different from random guessing, by conducting a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship to the Original Experiment\n",
    "While the original experiment with Dr. Bristol was on a small scale (8 trials), it tested the ability of a single individual to discern a personalized parameter (her taste preference). Our experiment, on the other hand, involves a much larger sample (80 students) and tests a more abstract ability to discern the order of pouring. The larger sample size in our case allows for more robust statistical analysis, and we're interested in whether the proportion of correct answers is significantly higher than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements of the Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (ùêª0): The students are just guessing, meaning the probability of correctly identifying whether milk or tea was poured first is 50%. Mathematically, this can be stated as:\n",
    "H0:p=0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation in Everyday Language: This hypothesis means that students are no better than chance at determining whether the milk or tea was poured first. If they are purely guessing, we expect about 50% of them to get it right just by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (ùêªùê¥): The students are not just guessing, meaning the probability of correctly identifying the order is different from 50%. We are interested in whether the proportion of correct responses is significantly greater than 50%. This can be stated as:\n",
    "HA:p>0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation in Everyday Language: This hypothesis suggests that the students have some ability to distinguish the order of pouring and are doing better than chance in their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "We will perform a formal hypothesis test by using the observed sample statistic and calculating the probability of observing a result as extreme as 49/80 correct answers under the null hypothesis (random guessing, where ùêª0: p = 0.5). Specifically, we'll calculate the p-value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Conclusion Regarding the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "Based on the computed p-value, if it is smaller than a significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence that STA130 students are not just guessing and have some ability to distinguish the order of pouring tea and milk.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is larger than 0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning we don't have enough evidence to claim that students are doing better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Remarks\n",
    "This analysis follows the steps of a formal hypothesis test similar to Fisher's original tea experiment. While the sample size and population differ, the logic of testing for the ability to distinguish between two processes (tea vs. milk poured first) remains the same."
