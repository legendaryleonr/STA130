    "Research Question: Does increased time spent socializing with friends correlate with increased satisfaction with life?\n",

    "**Variables:** CONNECTION_social_time_friends_p7d_grouped and WELLNESS_life_satisfaction from the 2021 cross-sectional survey.\n",

    "Visualization:\n",
    "Histogram: A histogram will be used to visualize the distribution of the time spent socializing with friends over the past 7 days. The histogram will show the frequency of participants in different time intervals (e.g., 0-1 hours, 1-3 hours, etc.). This helps in understanding the spread of social time across the sample, whether most participants report low, moderate, or high levels of socializing, and if there are any skewed distributions or peaks in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "Box Plot: A box plot is useful for showing the distribution of life satisfaction scores across participants, clearly showing the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers. This will give a visual interpretiation of the variation in life satisfaction and whether it is normally distributed or skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "we will use a Two-Tailed Permutation Test to examine if the observed correlation between the two variables is significantly different from what might occur by random chance. This approach is suitable as it does not rely on assumptions about the data distribution and provides a robust assessment of the correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also perform a Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between the number of close friends and mental health outcomes. This will allow us to quantify the strength and direction of the association between these variables. We will also assess whether there is an identifiable cut-off point where the trend terminates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will bootstrap the regression model to create a confidence interval for the estimated slope. This will help us assess the precision of our estimates and ensure that the relationship between the number of close friends and mental health outcomes is both significant and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will visualize the relationship using a scatter plot with a regression line, which will allow us to clearly illustrate the linear trend and assess whether a higher number of close friends is associated with better mental health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach assumes a linear association between the two variables. Furthermore, we assume that the two variables are independent of each other, meaning that one does not directly cause or influence the other outside of the correlation being tested. We also assume that the sample size is sufficiently large to ensure the robustness and statistical power of the correlation analysis. This is important for detecting a true relationship between the variables and for minimizing the risk of Type I or Type II errors. Additionally, we assume that each observation is randomly selected from its population and that the sample is unbiased, meaning it accurately represents the broader population. This ensures the generalizability of our findings. Lastly, when examining the potential cut-off point where the trend may terminate, we assume that there are no major confounding factors influencing the relationship between socializing and life satisfaction that could distort the observed pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: There is no association between time spent socializing with friends and level of life satisfaction. Rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that social bonding with friends plays a measurable role in one's level of life satisfaction, directly answering the research question by confirming or refuting the idea that increasing social bonding with friends can improve one's life satisfaction. The correlation coefficient would also allow us to determine the extent to which social connection with friends is associated with life satisfaction levels."

    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a Chi-Square Test of Independence to assess the relationship between the level of effort to connect with others and the frequency of loneliness. This approach is appropriate since both variables are categorical (one is ordinal and the other binary). The Chi-Square test will help determine whether there's a significant association between the effort put into connecting with others and feeling lonely. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also calculate Cramér's V to measure the strength of the association between the two variables. A higher Cramér's V value would suggest a stronger association between taking initiative to connect with others and the likelihood of feeling lonely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will analyze the relationship across the different levels of CONNECTION_effort_connect to see if there's a pattern in loneliness frequencies, specifically focusing on whether higher connection effort is associated with lower loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the relationship between the two variables, we will use a stacked bar chart that shows the proportion of people of felt lonely in the past week for each low/medium/high level of perceived effort to connect with others. This is the most appropriate visualizaion method to compare beteween a categorical and a binary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the sample size is sufficiently large to ensure the validity of the Chi-Square test, as small sample sizes can lead to inaccurate results or violate the test’s assumptions. We also assume that the responses are reliable and accurately reflect an individual’s effort to connect with others and their experience with loneliness. This includes assuming that respondents' self-reports of their connection efforts and loneliness are not biased or influenced by social desirability or other external factors. Furthermore, when calculating Cramér's V, we are assuming that the relationship between the two categorical variables is not influenced by lurking variables or confounding factors that could distort the association.\n",

    "Violin plot: A violin plot combines elements of a box plot and a density plot, allowing us to see both the distribution shape and the spread of responses in a single, comprehensive view. The violin plot will help reveal not only the central tendency (such as median and interquartile range) but also the distribution's full shape, showing where responses are concentrated and whether there are any areas with higher density. Through the violin plot, we can identify any skewness in the data, indicating whether most participants report having a few close friends or a larger circle. This plot is especially useful for detecting multi-modal distributions, where multiple peaks may suggest distinct subgroups within the sample—such as individuals who tend to have very few close friends versus those with a larger social network. Moreover, the violin plot’s structure enables a comparison of the spread within different ranges, highlighting if there’s considerable variability in responses or if they cluster around specific values.\n",

The histogram also provides insight into the variability of responses, showing whether ratings cluster tightly around certain values or are more evenly spread across the scale.
